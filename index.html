<p>Kbzb (pronounced 'kib-zib') is a Perl port of CodeIgniter, a kick-ass
web application framework for PHP. CodeIgniter's goal "is to enable 
you to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing 
code from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly 
needed tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to 
access these libraries."</p>

<p>Why write yet another web framework when so many already exist 
(Maypole, Catalyst, Jifty. CGI::Prototype, CGI::Application, 
Gantry...)? I've worked in many shops with apps written in both Perl 
and PHP, and maintenance is a headache because everything is done so 
differently. This addresses that. And as much as I'm a big fan of 
CodeIgniter?, I'm not a big fan of PHP. This addresses that, too.</p>

<p>DIFFERENCES FROM CodeIgniter</p>

<p>The places where Kbzb diverges from CodeIgniter are few but significant: 
namespaces, database access, HTML templating, configuration. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Perl packages provide namespaces, something most PHP versions sorely
lack. Kbzb uses packages as a simpler and cleaner alternative to some 
of the funky classloading tricks CodeIgniter goes through to allow 
you to extend or replace core libraries and to load helper modules. </p></li>
<li><p>Perl has long provided a high-level database abstraction package in 
DBI, something PHP sorely lacked until PDO came along.</p></li>
<li><p>Kbzb templates are not Perl scripts in the sense that CodeIgniter
templates are PHP scripts. Kbzb's template system is rather like
a light version of the well-known and widely-used Template::Toolkit
module; see the kbzb::libraries::parser module for details. </p></li>
<li><p>Kbzb configuration files are just that: plain text config files. 
CodeIgniter configuration files are PHP scripts that are include'ed
or require'ed into a class. This may change in a later version.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>INSTALLATION</p>

<p>You can install this module in the traditional way (perl Makefile.PL ...) 
or you can simply copy ./cgi-bin/kbzb.cgi into your webroot, and edit a 
few lines as indicated in the comments so that it knows where to find its 
libraries.</p>

<p>To install this module in the traditional way, do the following:</p>

<p>$ perl Makefile.PL
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install</p>

<p>$ cp cgi-bin/kbzb.cgi /path/to/cgi-bin/some-app/index.cgi
   $ cp -R app /path/to/app/directory/</p>

<p>edit the CGI script, setting the BASEPATH, APPPKG and APPPATH 
   variables as instructed by the comments. </p>

<p>DEPENDENCIES</p>

<p>Except for the database classes, Kbzb's core modules have NO dependencies
outside Perl 5.8.0. To use the database classes, you need the database
abstraction layer DBI (<a href="http://dbi.perl.org/">http://dbi.perl.org/</a>) and a platform-specific 
implementation layer provided by DBD 
(<a href="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/DBD/">http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/DBD/</a>), but everything else should run 
out of the box. This is, perhaps, a bad idea as CPAN provides all manner of 
modules which could make have made writing Kbzb easier. But part of 
CodeIgniter's philosophy is to make installation easy and dependency-free, 
and this project carries that forward.</p>
