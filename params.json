{"name":"Kbzb","tagline":"Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/kbzb","body":"kbzb version 0.01\r\n============================\r\n\r\nKbzb (pronounced 'kib-zib') is a Perl port of CodeIgniter, a kick-ass\r\nweb application framework for PHP. CodeIgniter's goal \"is to enable \r\nyou to develop projects much faster than you could if you were writing \r\ncode from scratch, by providing a rich set of libraries for commonly \r\nneeded tasks, as well as a simple interface and logical structure to \r\naccess these libraries.\"\r\n\r\nWhy write yet another web framework when so many already exist \r\n(Maypole, Catalyst, Jifty. CGI::Prototype, CGI::Application, \r\nGantry...)? I've worked in many shops with apps written in both Perl \r\nand PHP, and maintenance is a headache because everything is done so \r\ndifferently. This addresses that. And as much as I'm a big fan of \r\nCodeIgniter?, I'm not a big fan of PHP. This addresses that, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENCES FROM CodeIgniter\r\n\r\nThe places where Kbzb diverges from CodeIgniter are few but significant: \r\nnamespaces, database access, HTML templating, configuration. \r\n\r\n1. Perl packages provide namespaces, something most PHP versions sorely\r\n   lack. Kbzb uses packages as a simpler and cleaner alternative to some \r\n   of the funky classloading tricks CodeIgniter goes through to allow \r\n   you to extend or replace core libraries and to load helper modules. \r\n \r\n2. Perl has long provided a high-level database abstraction package in \r\n   DBI, something PHP sorely lacked until PDO came along.\r\n\r\n3. Kbzb templates are not Perl scripts in the sense that CodeIgniter\r\n   templates are PHP scripts. Kbzb's template system is rather like\r\n   a light version of the well-known and widely-used Template::Toolkit\r\n   module; see the kbzb::libraries::parser module for details. \r\n\r\n4. Kbzb configuration files are just that: plain text config files. \r\n   CodeIgniter configuration files are PHP scripts that are include'ed\r\n   or require'ed into a class. This may change in a later version.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION\r\n\r\nYou can install this module in the traditional way (perl Makefile.PL ...) \r\nor you can simply copy ./cgi-bin/kbzb.cgi into your webroot, and edit a \r\nfew lines as indicated in the comments so that it knows where to find its \r\nlibraries.\r\n\r\nTo install this module in the traditional way, do the following:\r\n\r\n   $ perl Makefile.PL\r\n   $ make\r\n   $ make test\r\n   $ make install\r\n   \r\n   $ cp cgi-bin/kbzb.cgi /path/to/cgi-bin/some-app/index.cgi\r\n   $ cp -R app /path/to/app/directory/\r\n   \r\n   edit the CGI script, setting the BASEPATH, APPPKG and APPPATH \r\n   variables as instructed by the comments. \r\n\r\n\r\nDEPENDENCIES\r\n\r\nExcept for the database classes, Kbzb's core modules have NO dependencies\r\noutside Perl 5.8.0. To use the database classes, you need the database\r\nabstraction layer DBI (http://dbi.perl.org/) and a platform-specific \r\nimplementation layer provided by DBD \r\n(http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/DBD/), but everything else should run \r\nout of the box. This is, perhaps, a bad idea as CPAN provides all manner of \r\nmodules which could make have made writing Kbzb easier. But part of \r\nCodeIgniter's philosophy is to make installation easy and dependency-free, \r\nand this project carries that forward.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT AND LICENSE\r\n\r\nThis software is derived from CodeIgniter 1.7.1, Copyright (c) 2008, EllisLab, Inc.\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2009 by Zak Burke\r\n\r\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the same terms as Perl itself, either Perl version 5.10.0 or,\r\nat your option, any later version of Perl 5 you may have available.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
